# Sicily - Interactive Chess Analysis Tool

Sicily is a real-time chess position analyzer that uses computer vision to detect chessboard positions from screenshots and provides AI-powered move suggestions using Stockfish.

## Features

- =ï¿½ **Screenshot Analysis**: Take interactive screenshots of chess positions from any application
- >ï¿½ **AI Position Recognition**: Uses TensorFlow to detect and analyze chess piece positions
- _ **Stockfish Integration**: Provides best move suggestions with configurable strength (ELO 800-2800)
- ï¿½ï¿½ **Dual Perspective Support**: Supports both White and Black perspectives with automatic board orientation detection
- <ï¿½ **Manual Override**: Force analysis for either side with simple keyboard commands
- =ï¿½ **Detailed Analysis**: Shows evaluation scores, top moves, and mate detection
- = **Real-time Processing**: Continuous analysis loop for live game assistance

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11
- macOS (uses `screencapture` utility)
- Stockfish chess engine

### Setup

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Ensure Stockfish binary is available:
   - Download `stockfish-macos-m1-apple-silicon` binary 
   - For other systems, download Stockfish and update the path in `sicily.py`

## Usage

### Basic Usage

Run the main script:
```bash
python3 sicily.py
```

## How It Works

1. **Screenshot Capture**: Uses macOS `screencapture -i` for interactive area selection
2. **Board Detection**: Computer vision algorithms locate the chessboard boundaries
3. **Piece Recognition**: TensorFlow model identifies individual pieces and positions
4. **FEN Generation**: Creates standard chess notation from detected position
5. **Orientation Detection**: Automatically determines if board is flipped (Black on bottom)
6. **Engine Analysis**: Stockfish evaluates position and suggests best moves
7. **Perspective Correction**: For Black analysis, flips centipawn values for proper perspective

## Board Orientation Support

Sicily automatically detects board orientation:

- **Normal Orientation**: White pieces on bottom (standard view)
- **Flipped Orientation**: Black pieces on bottom (playing as Black)

When Black pieces are detected on the bottom:
- Board FEN is automatically flipped for correct analysis
- Active player is set to Black
- Move suggestions are optimized for Black
